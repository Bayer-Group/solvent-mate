While the dependencies opsin and xtb can be installed via the conda package manager,
it might be more convenient to download them from their original sources and
just put the dependencies here. 
E.g. xtb binaries can be found here: https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb/releases
(for windows one would download e.g. xtb-6.6.1-windows-x86_64.zip and 
unzip it, then put the files within bin (xtb.exe) into this directory here!)

opsin jars can be found here: https://github.com/dan2097/opsin/releases/
(you have to download the cli-.jar file, e.g. 'opsin-cli-2.7.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar')
