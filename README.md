# Solvmate 
A practical ML framework for the recommendation of organic solvents
based on the paper
*Solvmate: A Practical Open Source Solvent Recommender based on Differential Solubility and Semiempirical
Feature Representations* (**citation link will follow**).

Given a compound as SMILES, and set of solvents as IUPAC names,
the solvents are recommended in increasing solubility.
